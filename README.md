Lab assigmenets completed in the course Network Programming course code TNPK18 using python.

## Smaller labs 1-4
- ###  Lab 2
This lab assignment involves creating a script to extract and analyze data from a file named "score2.txt." The script calculates and identifies the top scorers, displaying their names and respective scores. It's an exercise in data processing and analysis. 

- ### Lab 3
This program simulates a card game with three classes: CardClass representing individual playing cards, CardDeck for managing a deck of cards, and CardGame for playing the game. It creates and shuffles a deck of cards, then draws and displays cards with their values.

- ### Lab 4 
Implemented a function called fibbonacci(limit) that employs the 'yield' keyword to produce Fibonacci numbers. It calculates Fibonacci numbers until the value reaches or exceeds the specified limit. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.


## Using network connections lab 5-12
## Lab 5 
### Description
A basic program that enables two users to engage in a simplified Rock, Paper and Scissors game through a network connection. One user can act as the server, while the other can be the client. The server is first intalized in order for the client to make a connection. Then they take turns making moves and determine the winner based on the game's rules. The game continues until one player accumulates 10 points, and the overall winner is declared.


## Lab 7 
### Description 
A program that essentially sets up a basic chat server where multiple clients can connect and exchange messages in a chat room. The server acts as an intermediary that forwards messages from one client to all other connected clients. It uses non-blocking sockets to handle multiple clients simultaneously, and the communication is in plain text format.
